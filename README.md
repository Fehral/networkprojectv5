Redundancy  
  *  utilization of backup network resources to maintain continuity in case of device or system failure, human error, or cyber attack
  *  improves reliability, fault tolerance, performance, load balancing, disaster recovery

Device Security  
  *  networking best practices include utilizing authentication and encryption on critical devices such as routers and switches  

Encryption
  *  uses cryptography to obscure data such as login credentials and sensitive information such as names, addresses, Social Security Numbers, etc.
  *  symmetric encryption utilizes a single key-pair to encrypt and decrypt data
      *  Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Data Encryption Standard (DES), Triple DES (3DES), Blowfish, Twofish  
      *  Wi-Fi Protected Access v2 (WPA2), BitLocker utilize symmetric key-pairs  
  *  asymmetric encryption uses public-key cryptography, in which a public key is openly used for encryption and a private key is used for decryption  
      *  Rivest-Shimir-Adleman (RSA), Diffie-Hellman, Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), Digital Signature Standard (DSS), Transport Layer Security/Secure Socket Layer (TLS/SSL) Protocol
      *  various key sizes, e.g., 128-bit, 192-bit, 256-bit, 384-bit (for ECC)512-bit, 1024-bit, 2048-bit, 4096-bit 
      *  e-mail encryption, SSH authentication, document signing, secure web browsing, cryptocurrencies, virtual private networks (VPNs), and file encryption use asymmetric key-pairs

Port Security  
  *  on Cisco devices, refers to configuration of a switchport to allow limited access to certain Media Access Control (MAC) addresses  
      * configurations include number of MAC addresses that can communicate through a particular switchport  
      * administrative options such as shutdown and alerting the administrator if switchport security policy is violated
